Some random script I use regulary

 * do_chroot - dchroot wrapper which can be used by symlinkin
   [chroot name]_[command] -> do_chroot
 * git_list_branch - check several git repo branch status at once

All code is free in every way, provided as is, and I don't take any
responsibility if it kills your cat, burns your house or does anything else
unexpected :P
